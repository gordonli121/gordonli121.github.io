# <a name="about"></a>Who am I?

<img align="right" width="300px" src="assets/images/gordonli.png">

Hey, I'm Gordon. I'm a self-taught full-stack engineer with a mechanical engineering background.

I've tried out different things over the years such as manufacturing, mechatronics, controls system, and data analytics. Eventually, I decided to pivot my career path into software development during the pandemics, not only out of curiosity and interest, but also due to the flexibility this career would bring.

I started my journey with an online course on Udacity - Data Structures & Algorithms, where I learned basic programming concepts through hands-on projects and problem-solving. After a route planner project with A\* algorithm, I built a simple visualization tool with Pygame that animates the process of finding the shortest route. You can play with it [here](https://github.com/gordonli121/pathfinders/tree/master/pygame%20version).

After the course, I built a dynamic single-page web app that mimick the essential functionalities of a social networking platform. During this period, I acquired knowledge in Java, React, and MongoDB.

With no CS degree or any prior experience, it was quite difficult to find a job during the pandemics. Luckily, I picked up a contract intern position in a start-up called MeaningfulWork. I wore many hats and gained experience in frontend, backend, as well as DevOps work like CI/CD. During this internship, I got to know AWS and managed to obtain an [AWS Solutions Architect Certificate](https://www.credly.com/badges/48710788-5271-4196-9f5b-d7853b0e9bd8?source=linked_in_profile) during my free time. It was such an enjoyment to work with a group of passionate young talents towards a meaningful goal - facilitate positive social impact and give back to the community.

Nine months after my decision to change career path, with the skillset I had accumulated, I finally landed a full-time job as a full-stack engineer in an innovation team at Scotiabank, where we create MVP and PoC projects related to fintech, data analytics, and digital transformation initiatives.
